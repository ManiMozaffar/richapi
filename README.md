### Use Cases

RichAPI is designed to simplify FastAPI projects by automatically generating documented HTTP responses from HTTPException without extra effort! ðŸŽ‰

This project is inspired and completer version of [Kludex's Fast-Response project](https://github.com/Kludex/fastapi-responses)
This package is planned to have more features for now that might be essential for any FastAPI project later.
